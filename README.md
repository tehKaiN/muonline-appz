# MuOnline editors and misc apps

This repo contains minor stuff I've written during my MuOnline private server dev years (around 2006 - 2014). Most of Pascal sources are written and commented in Polish. If your translator won't help you enough, just start an issue - I'll translate them if needed. Don't expect any further updates though.

This repo consists of:

- **MuTexConv** - my first ever app for MuOnline - CLI tool which converts OZJ, OZB and OZT to JPG, BMP and TGA respectively. Converting back to game files works too.
- **MuMapConv** - converts between .map and .bmp.
- **MuMapEdit** - my final project for programming class from 2007. Partially done 2D map viwer & editor. Doesn't support JPG, so you need to convert all textures to BMP. Written in FreePascal and WinAPI.
- **wtf2txt** - Converts between WTF and TXT files. There are 2 versions of this app: one is written in Pascal, the newer one is in PHP.
- **MuBmd** - my attempt at finally make somewhat complete text BMD editor for all client versions. Allows defining fields for each BMD version.
- **MuClientAssemble** - allows assembling patch from any source version to any destination version, based on game's update server FTP dump. So if you've done one just like me you're in huge luck ;)
- **MuThreeJs** - game map previewer - incomplete, but works as a Proof-of-concept. Mouse handling has rotten apparently.

And some stuff, which might interest even non-coders:

- **MuConfig** - smallest game client's resolution/audio/auto login settings app you'll ever find on the Internet. Written in C & WinAPI using DevC++.
- **mulogo.svg** - a logo I traced for making icons and some minor gfx.

## Further development

If you feel like contributing to those apps and/or maintaining them in some way, feel free to do so - the source code is yours if you can understand it. ;) Should you make some nice progress be sure to notify me - I'll link your repo in this readme.
